UCG has some builtin libraries for common tasks. List processing, Tuple
manipulation, and some helpful testing assertions can all be found in the
standard library.

Each library is documented here in it's own section. Most operations in
the standard library are in the form of modules and by convention you get
the result of an operation from the `result` field after running the module.

Flags converts a tuple into a set of command line arguments for command line application.

The flags are converted using the following rules:

- keys in a tuple are converted into the argument name.
- values in a tuple are converted into the argument value.
- NULL values are not emitted.
- lists expand out into an argument for each item in the list.
  e.g. {{foo = [1, 2]}} becomes --foo=1 --foo=2
- tuples expand out into an argument with the key as a prefix separated by a `.`.
  e.g. {{foo = {{bar = 1, baz = 2}}}} becomes --foo.bar=1 --foo.baz=2
- Functions and Modules are ignored.

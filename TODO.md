# Major Planned Features

## Query Language (Experimental)

You should be able to ask the compiler to tell you any value or set of values in the
compiled configuration.

## Translation Language (Experiemental)

For some configuration file formats we need a way to specify a particular
organiztion for a given configuration structure. Some options here could be
 
* A Functional Transform (i.e. xslt, or css transforms)
* A Templating language

# Minor Fixes and Polish

* List parsing and semantics.
* Full selector support. (i.e. expressions in the selector parts)
   * List indexing?
* JSON export
* YAML export
* Error Reporting with Line, Column, and File information.

# Major Planned Features

## Query Language (Experimental)

You should be able to ask the compiler to tell you any value or set of values in the
compiled configuration.

## Translation Language (Experimental)

For some configuration file formats we need a way to specify a particular
organiztion for a given configuration structure. Some options here could be

* Simple data export (json) 
* A Functional Transform similar to xslt or css transforms.
* A Templating language
* Annotations.

# Minor Fixes and Polish

* Allow trailing commas
* Flags should allow different seperators for prefixed flags.
* None value types
* YAML export
